I made this because i needed an excuse to practice rust. I don't like reading. I prefer to bash my head against the keyboard, less theory, more dirt.

I try to do something every day, depends on what crap i get on college idfk

Anyway, I'm avaiable for intership, i guess. No, i don't have a linkedin, i had one and never used it, so i deleted because it was a waste.

Don't find me on twitter because we know ppl there are kinda cucu, and their cucu brain is infectious, hence why i don't use twitter, nor facebook, nor instagram, nor watever social media is out there

Just send me an email or something, idk. Anyway, gonna keep grinding this while i figure out how the heck i can make a good test case or something.

No, it doesn't have any test cases, I still don't know how to make those in rust, I'm learning the basics atm
