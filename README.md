The codingbat solutions, but in rust, because its fun

I made this because i needed an excuse to practice rust. I don't like reading. I prefer to bash my head against the keyboard, less theory, more dirt.

I try to do something every day, depends on what crap i get on college idfk

Anyway, I'm avaiable for intership, i guess. No, i don't have a linkedin, you can get me via email.

Anyway, gonna keep grinding this while i figure out how the heck i can make a good test case or something.

No, it doesn't have any test cases, I still don't know how to make those in rust, I'm learning the basics atm
